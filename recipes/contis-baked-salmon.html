    <h1>Conti's Baked Salmon</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Conti’s baked salmon is synonymous with holiday celebrations as Pinoy spaghetti and marshmallow hotdogs are with kids’ parties. It’s the go-to ~fancy~ seafood addition, its aluminum tray stealing the spotlight from the likes of fish fillet and rellenong bangus. Break it down, however, and its premium facade falls to reveal what it really is—just cream, a slab of salmon, and buttered vegetables.</p>
